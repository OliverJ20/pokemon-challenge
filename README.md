# pokemon-challenge

This challenge project took roughly 2 hours to get it to its current state.

It has some rough aspects and many aspects could be improved but I am happy with 
what it can do going from scratch in the timespan above.

yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
